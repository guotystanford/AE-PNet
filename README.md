This repository contains three folders. The meaning of files or folders are  
1. Python codes <br />
   1.1 AE-PNet_model_building_training: Model building, training and deployment of AE-PNet
   1.2 Data_preparation: Data preparation for training and testing AE-PNet  
2. Example data
   2.1 Manually pickings:.xlsx files saving information of waveform files and manual pickings
   2.2 Raw AE data: Raw AE waveform files
3. Trained models
   3.1 AEPNET_Aug_1500_train&valida_241119: AE-PNet model trained by 1500 waveforms (Data set # 15 in Table 2 in Guo et al., 2024 )
   3.2 AEPNET_Aug_40000_train&valida_241119: AE-PNet model trained by 1500 waveforms (Data set # 12 in Table 1 in Guo et al., 2024)

   Here are some suggestings for understanding and using the model
   1. Start from Python codes
   2. Example data helps understand Python codes
   3. Trained models can be directly loaded and deployed
