# This repository contains three folders. The meaning of files or folders are  
1. [Python codes](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Python%20codes) <br />
   1.1 [Data_preparation](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/blob/main/Python%20codes/Data_preparation_241119.ipynb): Data preparation for training and testing AE-PNet <br />
   1.2 [AE-PNet_model_building_training](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/blob/main/Python%20codes/AE-PNet_model_building_training_241119.ipynb): Model building, training and deployment of AE-PNet <br />
2. [Example data](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Example%20data) <br />
   2.1 [Manually pickings](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Example%20data/Manually%20pickings):.xlsx files saving information of waveform files and manual pickings <br />
   2.2 [Raw AE data](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Example%20data/Raw%20AE%20data): Raw AE waveform files <br />
   2.3 [Training test and validation data](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Example%20data/Training%20test%20and%20validation%20data) outupt by code "Data_preparation"
3. [Trained models](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Python%20codes) <br />
   3.1 [AEPNET_Aug_1500_train&valida_241119](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Trained%20models/AEPNET_Aug_1500_train%26valida_241119): AE-PNet trained by 1500 waveforms (Data set # 15 in Table 2 in Guo et al., 2024 ) <br />
   3.2 [AEPNET_Aug_40000_train&valida_241119](https://github.com/guotystanford/AE-PNet/tree/main/Trained%20models/AEPNET_Aug_40000_train%26valida_241119): AE-PNet trained by ~40000 waveforms (Data set # 12 in Table 1 in Guo et al., 2024)

# Here are some suggestings for understanding and using the model <br />
1. Start from Python codes <br />
2. Example data helps understand Python codes <br />
3. Trained models can be directly loaded and deployed <br />
4. The trained models can be retained for future use and fine-tuned as needed <br />
