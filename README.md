# This repository contains three folders. The meaning of files or folders are  
1. Python codes <br />
   1.1 AE-PNet_model_building_training: Model building, training and deployment of AE-PNet <br />
   1.2 Data_preparation: Data preparation for training and testing AE-PNet <br />
2. Example data <br />
   2.1 Manually pickings:.xlsx files saving information of waveform files and manual pickings <br />
   2.2 Raw AE data: Raw AE waveform files <br />
3. Trained models <br />
   3.1 AEPNET_Aug_1500_train&valida_241119: AE-PNet model trained by 1500 waveforms (Data set # 15 in Table 2 in Guo et al., 2024 ) <br />
   3.2 AEPNET_Aug_40000_train&valida_241119: AE-PNet model trained by 1500 waveforms (Data set # 12 in Table 1 in Guo et al., 2024)

# Here are some suggestings for understanding and using the model <br />
1. Start from Python codes <br />
2. Example data helps understand Python codes <br />
3. Trained models can be directly loaded and deployed <br />
